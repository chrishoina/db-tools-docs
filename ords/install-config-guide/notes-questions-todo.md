# Notes, questions, To-do

## Notes

## Questions/clarification

- How best to present/explain the "1.5 Privileges granted" section. How to break down the roles, users, privs.

Also, how best to explain 1.6 (I might want to go through the install a couple more times before I have you answer)

Can I break out the following into separate chapters: 

- Install
- Repair
- Upgrade 
- Uninstall
- Update config settigs 

## To-do

- Start building out Ch 2. 
- Need to include conventions for the code, see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/arpls/preface.html#GUID-823CBDED-EF90-4A66-9231-33ED2FB2A444).
